# Core Installation Command (Minimum):
# pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

# Full Installation Command:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative Lightweight Installation:
# pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy python-dateutil

# Production Deployment Additional Requirements:
# For cloud deployment, you might also need:
# - Cloud provider SDKs (AWS boto3, Google Cloud, Azure)
# - Monitoring tools (APM, logging)
# - Security packages (authentication, encryption)
# - Database drivers (specific to your data source)

# Streamlit Cloud Deployment:
# Streamlit Cloud automatically installs packages from requirements.txt
# Ensure all packages are compatible with Python 3.8+

# Docker Deployment Example Requirements:
# Add these to requirements.txt for containerized deployment:
# gunicorn>=20.1.0
# uvicorn>=0.18.0

# Notes:
# - Streamlit is the primary framework (free alternative to Power BI/Tableau)
# - Plotly provides interactive visualizations similar to Power BI charts
# - All packages are open source and free to use
# - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
# - Memory requirement: 2GB+ RAM recommended for smooth performance
# - Disk space: 500MB+ free space for package installation
